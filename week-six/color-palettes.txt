# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) Screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) An explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.
Filename: Q1.jpg
Explanation of your color choices:
	When I think of high end gaming laptops I think of Alien ware (at least before Dell).
The color scheme use was always a bright set of one color against a black background.
I choose a set of bright and dark blues to be used against its one black backdrop

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.
Filename: Q2.jpg
Explanation of your color choices:
	When many people think of healthy items that you would feed your family. 
They think of items that are the color green. Too bright of a green can still be very distracting. 
So I chose a set of greens that are a bit softer in color. 
However, I would still only use this color scheme sparingly with the color white.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.
Filename: Q3.jpg
Explanation of your color choices: 
	Money makes people nervous so I decided to use colors that calm people down. 
The purple reminds me of lavender which is both a calming scent and color. 
While the gray reminds me walking outside while it is raining, it might be a bit depressing, but it is definitely calming.
 

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.
Filename: Q4.jpg
Explanation of your color choices:
	I tried to choose colors that were bright, happy, and playful. They are also simple examples of primary colors. 
With children you don't need to worry about clashing, you should worry more about attracting attention.
At the very least these colors will do just that, hopefully, in the least annoying way possible.
